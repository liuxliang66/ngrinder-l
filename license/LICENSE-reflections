The open source community has been flooded with lots of nearly identical licenses.
We'd like to see projects standardize on the most popular, time-tested ones. For
that reason, we encourage projects that we host to use one of the licenses listed
on our project creation page. The offered licenses offer enough diversity to meet
most developer needs, while minimizing license proliferation.

Apache License 2.0
Artistic License/GPL
Eclipse Public License 1.0
GPL v2
GPL v3
LGPL
MIT License
Mozilla Public License 1.1
New BSD License

If for some reason, your project cannot use one of the ones listed, there is an option
in the license selector to allow the use other OSI approved licenses. Simply select 
¡°Other Open Source¡± and indicate in your LICENSING, COPYING or similar file which 
license you are using.
